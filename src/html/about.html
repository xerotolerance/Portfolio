    <h3>Mission</h3>
    <p>
      I am a versatile developer with the ability to learn any programming language quickly
      and apply it skillfully. Over the last four years I have honed my skills and cultivated
      a repertoire of programming languages, including but not limited to
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3Axerotolerance+language%3Ac">C</a>,
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3Axerotolerance+language%3Ac%2B%2B">C++</a>,
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3Axerotolerance+language%3Ac%23">C#</a>,
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3Axerotolerance+language%3Ajava">Java</a>,
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3Axerotolerance+language%3Apython">Python</a>,
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3Axerotolerance+language%3Ajavascript">JavaScript</a>,
      &amp; <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3Axerotolerance+language%3Aphp">PHP</a>.<br><br>
      More than anything, I aspire to become a Senior Software Engineer for a top technology firm which pioneers projects
      that will leave a lasting impact on the world.
      </p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
      I understand that employers are looking for promising and innovative individuals who will work
      together as a whole to strive toward progress; I would be honored to be one of those individuals.</p>
    <p>
      Software development matches my professional interests and piques my
      personal interests. It is the perfect career choice for me.<br>
      For me, working in the industry is the best way to
      build experience & professional relations and to enhance my technical aptitude
      while still helping to develop meaningful, directed software with real-world applications.</p>
